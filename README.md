# Smart-Gate-Security-System

## Introduction

A sliding door is a type of door that opens horizontally by sliding, either mounted on or suspended from a rail. Sliding doors are used in various applications such as shower doors, glass doors, mesh doors, and wardrobes. They are also suitable for school buildings, halls, auditoriums, banks, shopping malls, and departmental buildings.

Automation refers to making processes or machines self-acting or self-moving. Automatic sliding doors are a part of this automation trend, reducing the need for human intervention and improving accessibility.

## Types of Automatic Doors

1. **Automatic Swinging Door**: Includes single or double doors that swing in or out, with various configurations and sensors.
2. **Automatic Telescopic Door**: Used for narrow openings, with leaves sliding at different speeds.
3. **Revolving Automatic Door**: Ideal for high-traffic areas, saves energy, and maintains a uniform indoor climate.
4. **Automatic Parking Barrier**: Operated remotely to control parking access.
5. **Automatic Balanced Door**: Combines the benefits of swing and sliding doors, suitable for small spaces.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to design and construct an Advanced Automatic Sliding Door System prototype with added security features such as:
- Fingerprint scanner
- Face detection algorithm
- Keypad lock

### Reasons for Advancement

1. **Convenience**: Automatic doors eliminate the need for manual operation, making them accessible for the elderly, disabled, and those carrying heavy items.
2. **Safety and Security**: Properly installed automatic doors offer enhanced security by ensuring the door remains closed, reducing the need for additional locks and security systems.
